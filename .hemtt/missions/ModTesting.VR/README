Run any of these script in the init box of any object in eden to activate it:

[this] execVM "scripts\[ScriptName].sqf";

For example I'd use this block on all starting area arsenals:

[this, false, [0, 0, 0], 0] call ace_dragging_fnc_setDraggable;   
[this, false, [0, 0, 0], 0] call ace_dragging_fnc_setCarryable;   
clearMagazineCargo this;
clearWeaponCargo this;
clearItemCargoGlobal this;
this allowdamage false;
[this] execVM "Arsenal\InitArsenal.sqf";

[this] execVM "VehicleSpawner\InitSpawner.sqf";

Exclude any scripts that don't apply.

To apply these scripts as zeus simply replace "this" with "_this".

[_this] execVM "scripts\[ScriptName].sqf";

The TireRepairer script is meant for use in a motor pool for more realistic vehicle repair. It requires a marker named "TireRepairZone" somewhere on the map - ideally near the object this script is applied to as a start button - where damaged tires are placed. Inside is a variable named _timeForRepair that determines the seconds it takes to repair a single tire.

To add more pads to the vehicle spawner run the following code on the spawn terminal replacing pad_x with a new pad name and player with any object at the pad position.

pad_x = createTrigger ["EmptyDetector", getPosASL player]; 
pad_x setPosASL getPosASL player;
pad_x setTriggerArea [5, 5, 0, true];
systemChat format ["Spawned at %1", getPosASL pad_x];
pads append [pad_x];
